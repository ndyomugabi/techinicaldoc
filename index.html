                    <p style="color:rgb(183, 185, 187);">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
                        It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment 
                        (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the 
                        objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                     </p></style>
                     <P style="color:rgb(183, 185, 187);">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, 
                         and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control 
                         structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
                          of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example</P>

                             <p><li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                               objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).

                                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by
                                     supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. 
                                     For example, server-side extensions allow an application to 
                                     communicate </li>

                            <ul>
                               <p><li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW)</li></p>
                               <p> <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML</li></p>
                               <p> <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one 
                                   of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li></p>

                            </ul>
                            <p> <h2>JavaScript and Java </h2> </p>
                            <p style="color:rgb(183, 185, 187);"> JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
                                The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong 
                                type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and 
                                basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to 
                                JavaScript.</p>

                                <p style="color:rgb(183, 185, 187);"> In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript 
                                    supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, 
                                    Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of 
                                    the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic 
                                    inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript 
                                    also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be 
                                    properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

                                     <p style="color:rgb(183, 185, 187);"> JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare
                                          all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether 
                                          methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. 
                                          Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
